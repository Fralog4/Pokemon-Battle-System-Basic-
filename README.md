# Pokémon Battle System

A simplified Pokémon battle simulation

## Features

- Round-based battle system with Pokémon attacking each other
- Detailed output of each round, including attack power, defense, damage done, and remaining health
- Prevention of the same Pokémon being involved in a battle


## Java Skills

This project demonstrates the application of three essential Java skills:

* **Encapsulation:** The `Pokemon` class encapsulates the Pokémon's attributes, such as name, health, attack, and defense, within its instance variables. This ensures that these attributes are protected from direct manipulation and promotes data integrity.

* **Inheritance:** The `Pokemons` come from a superclass `Pokemon` that is extended to the `Pokemon types` 

* **Constructors:** The `Pokemon` class utilizes constructors to initialize the Pokémon's attributes when they are created, ensuring that they have accurate values from the start. This simplifies object creation and promotes cleaner code.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional Pokémon types and attacks to enhance the battle experience.

* Introduce special moves and abilities to add depth and strategic options to the battle system.

I hope you enjoy this simplified Pokémon battle simulation.
